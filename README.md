# pudgy-penguins-sales-bot

A simple Twitter bot that Subscribes to the Pudgy Penguins contract's Transfer event. If an OpenSea or LooksRare sale is detected, a tweet is sent out from a Twitter account dedicated to tracking Pudgy Penguin sales. Marketplace aggregators (like gem and genie) as well as ENS support coming soon.
